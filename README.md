# Global Autoparts – E-Commerce with Microservices

This repository contains the final project for the *Programación de Microservicios* course.  
The system implements a real-world e-commerce platform that demonstrates a **microservices architecture**, secure user authentication using **JWT**, and frontend-backend interaction using PHP/Blade templates.

## Overview

Global Autoparts is an e-commerce system for selling auto parts.  
The project is structured into multiple independent services, each responsible for a distinct domain of functionality, enabling modular development and deployment.

This project was designed as a learning exercise to understand:

- How microservices communicate with each other and handle business logic
- The role of JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure authentication
- How frontend interfaces (PHP/Blade) interact with backend services
- API endpoint design and usage

The design reflects core principles of microservices: decentralization, independent deployability, and clear API contracts.

## Technologies Used

**Backend**
- PHP (Laravel Blade for templates)
- REST APIs for service-to-service communication
- JWT for authentication

**Frontend**
- Blade templates (PHP)
- Server-rendered views that interact with backend APIs

**Architecture**
- Microservices using separate modules for:
  - API endpoints
  - Administration
  - Client views

**Tools**
- Git for version control
- Composer for managing PHP dependencies
